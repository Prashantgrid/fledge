# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Check requirements:
    - [Julia 1.3](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
2. Clone or download repository.
3. In Julia, run `]activate path_to_fledge_repository; instantiate; precompile`.

## Known issues

- FLEDGE may fail under Julia 1.0 due to usage of `eachrow()` and `eachcol()`.

## Usage

There are currently no examples / tutorials as the repository is still work-in-progress. Please see the [test directory](https://github.com/TUMCREATE-ESTL/FLEDGE.jl/tree/develop/test) for preliminary examples.
