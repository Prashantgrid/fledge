# Documentation

The documentation is automatically published on Read the Docs whenever commits are pushed to `develop` or `master`. To generate the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. In the Python environment where CoBMo is installed, run `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt`.
2. In `docs` directory, run `make html`.
